SECTION 12. AI text Generation Services

We use providers to use AI service, so Privacy Policy of providers applies.
Our AI system is BYOK per server, meaning each server owner inputs their own API key to use the AI service.
We do store your API key in our SQL database. We do not share your API key with anyone else other than the AI service provider when you use the AI service.
When you use the AI service, we send your prompt and necessary metadata to the provider to generate a response. We do not store your prompts or responses.

We carefully select providers/routers that respect user privacy. We currently use the following providers/routers: OpenRouter, OpenAI, Claude.

None of the providers/router should train their models using your data when you use our service, as we set the data collection option to "deny" when sending requests, and disallow providers which may train their models using user data.

Any concern about your data, or our providers, simply contact us : expurgation@duck.com
However, if the concern is about providers, you should contact them directly. I can tell which provider is used for your request.

SECTION 13. AI image generation services

We currently use TAMS (Tensor Art Model Service) for AI image generation.
You can check their privacy policy here: https://tensor.art/ko-KR/about/privacy-policy

Since the provider is located in China, your data is handled according to Chinese laws. I send minimal data to the provider, only the image generation prompt and necessary metadata are sent. No personal identifying information is sent to the provider.

We can't view or store your image generation prompts or generated images.
